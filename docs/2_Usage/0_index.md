## Usage

The SDK provides category methods on standard ResearchKit classes, allowing you 
to save and fetch `ORKResult` object subclasses, such as `ORKTaskResult` and `ORKStepResult`,
to and from the [CloudMine Connected Health Cloud](http://cloudmineinc.com/platform/developer-tools/).

You can see the full documentation and class references on [CocoaPods](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/CMHealth/)
or [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudmine/CMHealthSDK-iOS/tree/master/docs).
